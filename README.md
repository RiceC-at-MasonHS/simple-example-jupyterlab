# Simple Example Jupyter Notebook
This notebook is just meant for a bare-bones example with Jupyter Notebook. 

For anyone on a Chromebook (most HS students) You can use [Jupyter's Online Lab](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/lab/) to play with this example.
Download the [simple-example.ipynb](simple-example.ipynb) file, and you can upload it to the Jupyter Online Lab.

> [!TIP]
> The second *real* cell `[2]:` will throw an error in the web-based version: that is expected and fine. 

---
If you have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can run it and upload this example.
Know that it will install `numpy` and `matplotlib` globally for you. *...but you probably wanted that anyway*🤓
